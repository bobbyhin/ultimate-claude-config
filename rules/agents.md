# When to Use Agents

Use agents for complex tasks:

- /planner → planning new features
- /architect → system design decisions
- /code-reviewer → code review
- /security-reviewer → security audit
- /e2e-runner → E2E testing
- /build-error-resolver → fix build errors
- /doc-updater → update documentation
- /refactor-cleaner → remove dead code

Delegate when task needs focused expertise.

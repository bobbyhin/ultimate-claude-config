| architect | System design | Architectural decisions |
| tdd-guide | Test-driven development | New features, bug fixes |
| code-reviewer | Code review (TS/JS) | After writing code |
| security-reviewer | Security analysis | Before commits |
| build-error-resolver | Fix build errors (TS/JS) | When build fails |
| e2e-runner | E2E testing | Critical user flows |

| doc-updater | Documentation | Updating docs |
| database-reviewer | PostgreSQL optimization | Schema/query review |
| py-error-resolver | Fix Python errors | Python ruff/pyright errors |
| py-reviewer | Python code review | Review Python/FastAPI code |
| go-build-resolver | Fix Go build errors | Go compilation errors |
| go-reviewer | Go code review | Review Go code |
| dart-error-resolver | Fix Dart/Flutter errors | Dart analyzer errors |
| dart-reviewer | Dart/Flutter code review | Review Flutter code |

## Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:
1. Complex feature requests - Use **planner** agent
2. Code just written/modified - Use **code-reviewer** agent
3. Bug fix or new feature - Use **tdd-guide** agent
4. Architectural decision - Use **architect** agent

## Parallel Task Execution

ALWAYS use parallel Task execution for independent operations:

```markdown
# GOOD: Parallel execution
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: Security analysis of auth.ts
2. Agent 2: Performance review of cache system
3. Agent 3: Type checking of utils.ts

# BAD: Sequential when unnecessary
First agent 1, then agent 2, then agent 3
```

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

For complex problems, use split role sub-agents:
- Factual reviewer
- Senior engineer
- Security expert
- Consistency reviewer
- Redundancy checker
